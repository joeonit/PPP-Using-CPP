# Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++

This repository includes solutions to 'drills' and exercises, along with my notes from going through the book.

## Motivation Behind Choosing This Book

After reading the first two chapters, I found myself admiring Bjarne Stroustrup's teaching philosophy. Stroustrup, the author of the book and the creator of C++, describes his approach in the 'Notes to the Reader' chapter as 'concrete-first and depth-first with an emphasis on concepts and techniques.' The inclusion of 'Drills' and exercises was a factor in my choice, as was the use of C++ as a tool for learning. My familiarity with the language and its significance in finance, banking, and quantitative development, areas Iâ€™m interested in, also played a role in my choice.

## About the Repository
